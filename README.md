# Restaurant Landing Page Design

This repository also includes the **Figma design** for a Restaurant Landing Page.

## 🎨 About the Design

The Figma file contains the conceptual design for a restaurant landing page. This design showcases my learning journey with **Figma** as I explore the basics of UI/UX design. It includes layouts for key sections like **Header**, **About Us**, **Menu**, and **Contact**.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

**Figma**: For creating and structuring the design.

## 🤔 Why This Design?

I am in the early stages of learning **Figma** and UI/UX principles. This project is my practice attempt at creating clean and visually appealing designs that are easy to interpret for development.

## 🚀 What's Next?

Learning more advanced Figma features such as prototyping, animations, and responsive design. Experimenting with new layouts and modern design trends. Collaborating with developers to understand design-to-code workflows better.

## 📂 Files Included
